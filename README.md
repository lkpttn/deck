# Canvas Cards
Canvas Cards is a gallery of card designs created with javasript canvas. Updated every week in 2019, each card 
includes an editable code block so feel free to tweak and make your own designs. Created
by <a href="https://twitter.com/friendofpixels" target="_blank">Luke Patton</a>
and hosted by <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/canvas-cards">Glitch</a>. If
you'd like to know more about the project, I wrote a <a href="https://friendofpixels.com/posts/making-canvas-cards">retrospective</a>
detailing my process and tools. I've also put up a standalone <a target="_blank" href="https://canvas-card-builder.glitch.me/">card builder</a>
that makes it easier to play around.

The cards are licensed under <a rel="license" href="https://anticapitalist.software/" target="_blank">The Anti-Captialist Software License</a>. 
You can freely use any of the code and images here, even to make your own decks, but they can never be sold or profited from. The cards are 
not and will not ever be available as NFTs or other crypto assets.
